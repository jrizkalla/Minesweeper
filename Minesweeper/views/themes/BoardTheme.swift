            - rect: the `NSRect` to draw in
            - tile: the `Board.UserTile` to draw
            - state: the state of the tile (normal, pressed, or right pressed)
            - enabled: whether or not the board view is enabled
            - cachedPaths: a bunch of cached `NSBezierPath`s. If the tile is not changed, an array of paths are given so that the theme does not have to redraw it. The array passed is the same one returned by `drawTileInRect` the last time it was called
        - Returns: an array of paths to cache (can be empty)
