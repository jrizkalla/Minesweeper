            - cachedPaths: a bunch of cached `NSBezierPath`s. If the tile is not changed, an array of paths are given so that the theme does not have to redraw it. The array passed is the same one returned by `drawTileInRect` the last time it was called
        - Returns: an array of paths to cache (can be empty)
